## About 
Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is a significant contributor to the overall global burden of disease. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Another alarming revelation is that more than 50% of the population
is not aware that they are suffering from depression.
## GOALS
Our aim is to address this problem by creating a WE BAND which will detect stress, its levels and will provide with the best solution.
