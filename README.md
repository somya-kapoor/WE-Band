# WE-Band

## ABOUT
Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is a significant contributor to the overall global burden of disease. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Another alarming revelation is that more than 50% of the population is not aware that they are suffering from depression.

## GOALS
Our aim is to address this problem by creating a WE BAND which will detect depression, its levels and will provide with the best solution. These levels will be calculated with the help of Google search history of the user and fluctuation in the concentration of specific chemicals which account for depression in the body.
